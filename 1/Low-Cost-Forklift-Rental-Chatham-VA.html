<p>Numerous product options, which provide the necessary load capacity and lifting heights, are also available within the reach truck series.

If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
