In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. Identify the maximum load weight you need to lift, and rent a forklift that could support such capacity. The Black Widow is a professionally lifted truck by SCA Performance.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
