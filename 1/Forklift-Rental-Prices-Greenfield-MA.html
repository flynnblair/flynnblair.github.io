<h3>What Is A Forklift (FLT) Greenfield MA 01301</h3>
<p>All-terrain and rough terrain forklifts are the preferred lift truck type for construction sites, ranches, farms and other outdoor environments. If you don't see what you want, AutoNation Chevrolet South Clearwater can custom order one for you and get the off-road lifted truck in 3-6 weeks. We only sell the very best, and we want St Louis, Granite City, and Edwardsville drivers to know it. Give us a call if you have any questions or have an interest in finding out additional information about these trucks.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
