<p>Load-facing operator controls also improve the efficiency of the operator. NARROW-AISLE TRUCK: A self-loading truck primarily intended for right-angle stacking in aisles narrower than those normally required by counterbalanced trucks of the same capacity (Fig. The counterbalance forklift comes in both a three and four-wheel variety and can be powered by gas , diesel and electric They are very powerful and useful trucks for a number of different environments, lifting a variety of heavy loads.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies.

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse.
