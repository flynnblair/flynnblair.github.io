<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.

<p>Workers need to be trained in proper load management before operating this forklift. Before you can spice up your life with a lifted ride, you likely are in need of some financial help.

A wide variety of industrial reach trucks options are available to you, such as new. In the UK, there are six approved training companies: Association of Industrial Truck Trainers (AITT), Independent Training Standards Scheme and Register (ITSSR), Lantra Awards , National Plant Operators Registration Scheme , Road Transport Industry Training Board (RTITB), Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).</p>
