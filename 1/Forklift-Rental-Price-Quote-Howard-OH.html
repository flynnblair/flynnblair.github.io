Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<h3>Portable Forklift Howard OH</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc. Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>

<p>Order pickers do exactly what their name implies - they pick” orders in a warehouse for stores, other distribution centers, retail centers, and more. Once you've decided on the forklift fuel type and lifting capacity, begin your search for unused and used forklifts in our current inventory. You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
