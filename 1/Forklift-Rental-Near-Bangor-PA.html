<h2>What Kind Of License Do I Need To Drive A Forklift Bangor </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
