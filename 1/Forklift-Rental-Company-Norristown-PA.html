We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>

When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs.
