<p>This description refers to the type of pallet or product the jack is able to carry. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers. This is mainly due to the presence of the prominent players across the U.S. These players are indulged in making heavy investments in adopting the advance and modern Forklift Trucks rather than the conventional Forklift Trucks.</p>
