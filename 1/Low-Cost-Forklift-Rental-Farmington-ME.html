<h3>What Is A Forklift (FLT) Farmington ME 04938</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit. Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. 123Forklift makes it easy to compare forklift prices, service plans and warranties on all used forklifts.</p>
