<p>Order picker forklifts enable operators to directly pick stock from aisles onto an empty pallet. Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces. Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc. Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts. If you're looking for a little extra clearance and bigger, badder tires for the ultimate off-road experience, this might be exactly the lift you're looking for.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
