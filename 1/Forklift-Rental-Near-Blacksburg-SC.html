<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. Service brakes shall enable the truck to develop a drawbar drag equal to a percent of the gross vehicle weight (with rated capacity load) per the second column of the table on next page, while the truck is being towed slowly in either direction. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design.

Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction. The new products offer advances in efficiency technology with their optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking.</p>
