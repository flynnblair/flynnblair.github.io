The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance.

<p>You can rely on Westminster Lift Truck Services. These forklifts can come with lifting heights of up to 20 feet. Before OSHA can issue a standard, it must go through a very extensive and lengthy process that includes substantial public engagement, notice and comment. The cages are manufactured in accordance with the strictest safety standards, including AS 2359.1. Both cages - type MWPOP and MWPOPG - must only be used by a dedicated Order Picking Forklift.</p>
<p>The purpose of this standard is to promote safety in the design, construction, application, operation, and maintenance of powered industrial trucks. Businesses experiencing high growth, rapid change or other factors that might introduce an element of unpredictability may benefit from a flexible rental plan. The Manitou M-Series masted‚Äù forklift range has models with lift capacities from 5,700 to 15,400 pounds, all powered by a 75-horsepower Perkins engine and available with torque-converter type or hydrostatic transmissions.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>

Established in 1992, the National Plant Operators Registration Scheme is now one of the UK's leading Accreditation and Registration Bodies, working across the Construction, Industrial, Utilities, Warehousing and Distribution, Agricultural, Ports and Marine sectors.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
