We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>

At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car. Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000. For over 50 years, Liftking has grown to be the home of a complete line of Rough Terrain forklifts for both commercial and military clients.

<p>Due to ineffective (or nonexistent) training, many forklift drivers aren't aware of max load capacities, or how to safely navigate their workspace with a heavy load. Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>

Bringing your custom lifted truck or SUV dreams into fruition, our financing associates will work closely with your budget and uncover a loan or lease that best coincides with your needs.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. While there is no single best pallet jack, high-quality pallet jacks are made by companies such as Linde or Jungheinrich. These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. And, the Raymond Model 8410 pallet truck with second-level pick steps offers three heavy-duty, non-slip steps—accessible from either side of the truck—that lead to a picking platform for easy access to second-level load beams.</p>
