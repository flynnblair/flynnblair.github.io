When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.
