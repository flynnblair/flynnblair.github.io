<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions. It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations. Lifted trucks are never seen in New England, the New York area, the Miami area, or Hollywood.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
