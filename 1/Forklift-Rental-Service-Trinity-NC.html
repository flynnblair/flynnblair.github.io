The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

After learning about each of these appliances and their uses, it is essential to sit down and reflect.
