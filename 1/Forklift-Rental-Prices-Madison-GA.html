<p>Order picker forklifts enable operators to directly pick stock from aisles onto an empty pallet. Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces.

The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use. For anyone who is an adventurous individual or need a truck with significant size and power, then you really have to test drive one of our lifted trucks.</p>
