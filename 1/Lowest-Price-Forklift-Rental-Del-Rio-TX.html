On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

There will never be a shortage of other truck lovers who want a lifted truck. A sit-down electric reach truck with a 4,500 lb capacity might cost around $30,000 to $40,000. Weight capacity runs 6,000-12,000 lbs.</p>
