We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>
<h2>High Lift Pallet Truck Shingle Springs </h2>
<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>

The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you. The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>

<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate. We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day. This machine is designed with a low stowed height to allow for superior maneuverability through entryways. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts come equipped with exclusive features and technologies, delivering superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics, and unmatched efficiency.</p>

<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Most counterbalanced forklifts have a three-point suspension system, meaning that the truck is supported at the two front wheels and the center of the steer axle.
