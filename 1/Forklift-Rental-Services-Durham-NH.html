<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

<p>To simulate an operator, a 200 pound weight should be located with the center of gravity centered 40 inches above the operator's platform. The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
