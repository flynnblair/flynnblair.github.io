Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, of a load with a stated horizontal and vertical distance to the center of gravity of the load that a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable also on 406 of this Standard, can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.
