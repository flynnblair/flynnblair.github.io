<h2>CLARK Material Handling Company Montevideo </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably. Forklift truck sales in North America saw their third consecutive year of growth in 2017, the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) reports.

The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps” the jack to lift the skids with their own force. Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.
