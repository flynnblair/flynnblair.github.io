<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Engine power is often a critical component of buying a rough terrain forklift. The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles. The TAWI Mobile Order Picker is a one-of-a-kind solution for mobile material handling and order picking from pallet racks. A lifted truck is a truck that has had its suspension altered to increase the height of the vehicle, and sometimes fitted with large wheels.</p>

On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
