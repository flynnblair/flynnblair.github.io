Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>

These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

From a pallet jack to a telehandler, Lencrow Forklifts has Australia's largest and most comprehensive range of new, used and hire equipment.

<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles. Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
