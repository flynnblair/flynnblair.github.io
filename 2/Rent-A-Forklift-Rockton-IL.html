<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
