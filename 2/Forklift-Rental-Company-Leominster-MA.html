Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Apart from the manufacturers, various truck associations are also participating in taking necessary initiatives that can help to enhance the productivity and safety concerns of the lift trucks operations. Call us for forklift service, forklift sales, or forklift repairs. Cat lift trucks are manufactured and distributed by Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift America Inc.</p>

<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator. The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team.</p>
