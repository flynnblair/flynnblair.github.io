It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.
