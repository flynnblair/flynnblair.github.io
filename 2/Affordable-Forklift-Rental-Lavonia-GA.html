Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery. Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Our range of advanced low-level order pickers are designed for intensive picking in demanding environments. Please note: we only set up accounts for forklift traders and dealers.

<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments.

<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation.

<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck.

Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
