<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Go look on the trails that I drive and you won't see any of the radically lifted trucks at all. Raymond sit down lift trucks are intelligently engineered and designed to work as stand-alone products or as part of an integrated material handling solution, helping operators move products throughout any warehouse.

<p>Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles.

Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>
