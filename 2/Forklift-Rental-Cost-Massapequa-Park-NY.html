In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>This removes the need for the operator to manually adjust the tines for different sized loads. Electric forklifts are quiet as well, making them ideal for warehouse and other indoor use. Be mindful of pedestrians, other industrial lift trucks, vehicles, materials, etc. Whether you need a forklift for one day or five years, Crown has a rental solution for you.
