<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The configurable Raymond 4750 4-Wheel Sit-Down Counterbalanced Forklift, well-known for its operator-friendly, open-mast” visibility, industry-leading ergonomics, and superior maintainability offers new features focused on better productivity, lower long-time costs, and enhanced driver comfort. Forklifts have entirely transformed the storage and shipping industries.</p>
<h2>Pallet Jacks Move Heavy Objects Hialeah </h2>
<p>Importantly, the electric pallet jack has been built with safety reverse button as well as the good quality steel. The four-wheel versions are Class 4 forklifts. The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two. An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>

And there is a good reason for that: they are extremely well adapted to the confines and materials handling needs of the department store. These lift trucks are designed to maximize unit load capacity by narrowing aisles and promoting product throughput.</p>

<p>Unused pallet jacks are a major trip hazard. Electric forklifts are battery-powered and will generally last through one standard shift before needing to be recharged. Even if you've never walked into a warehouse or never even seen a forklift or order picker, our training caters to all types of skill levels. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality.
