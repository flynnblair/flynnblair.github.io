<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>
<h2>Reach Truck Lexington</h2>
