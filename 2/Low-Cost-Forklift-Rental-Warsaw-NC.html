Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.

If your company has an accident or injury with a forklift, OSHA will investigate and request training records.
