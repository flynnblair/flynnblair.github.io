We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges.

<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs.
